# Reflection

## Future functionality

- Store transactions in a database rather than an `ArrayList`
- Miners can broadcast to other miners (listening from the receiving miner is what I was having trouble with)

## What did I learn?

- Cryptographic algorithms
- Understanding of how a crytpocurrency works
- Understanding of how blockchain works
- Understanding of how a P2P network works
- Like bit of socket coding
- Strengthened my Java OOP skills
